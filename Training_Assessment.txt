Training Analysis Summary: MARL PPO for Tactical Environment
Training Session 1
Configuration

Environment: Full tactical environment with multiple enemies
Episodes: 1000
Max Steps: 1000 per episode
Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 3e-4
Entropy coefficient: 0.01
Value coefficient: 0.5
PPO clip: 0.2



Performance

Rewards: Initially around -142.86, improved to -71.43 by episode ~600, then plateaued
Steps: Consistently reached max (1000) steps per episode
Casualties: Zero friendly and enemy casualties throughout
Actor Losses: Very small (~10^-3), indicating minimal policy updates
Critic Losses: Inconsistent across agents - only agents 2 and 6 showed significant losses
Entropy Losses: Consistently zero, suggesting deterministic policies with no exploration

Key Insights

Agents learned basic navigation/positioning (evidenced by reward improvement)
Failed to engage in combat or complete objectives
Reached a learning plateau after ~600 episodes
Zero entropy loss indicated premature convergence to deterministic policies
Limited exploration prevented discovery of effective combat tactics

Training Session 2
Configuration

Environment: Simplified curriculum with bare terrain and single enemy near objective
Episodes: 1000
Max Steps: 1000 per episode
Hyperparameters (adjusted):

Learning rate: Increased to 5e-4
Entropy coefficient: Significantly increased to 0.05-0.1
Value coefficient: Increased to 1.0
PPO clip: Increased to 0.3



Performance

Rewards: Consistently around -0.50
Steps: Still reaching max (1000) steps per episode
Casualties: Zero friendly and enemy casualties
Actor Losses: Higher (~-0.0055), indicating more meaningful policy updates
Critic Losses: More reasonable (0.0082 average)
Entropy Losses: Substantially higher (-4.51 average), indicating proper exploration

Key Insights

Successfully increased exploration through entropy coefficient adjustment
Agents actively exploring but not yet discovering successful strategies
More meaningful policy updates occurring (higher actor losses)
Better value estimation developing (more reasonable critic losses)
Learning better exploration but not yet connecting to successful outcomes

Comparative Analysis
The adjustments between sessions produced significant improvements in training dynamics:

Exploration: Dramatic improvement in exploration behavior from zero entropy loss to substantial negative entropy loss
Learning Progress: Session 1 showed plateauing with zero policy improvement, while Session 2 shows ongoing learning with meaningful updates
Policy Development: Session 1 converged prematurely to suboptimal policies, while Session 2 maintains exploration of policy space
Efficiency: Despite similar outcomes (no objectives completed, no casualties), Session 2 shows healthier learning dynamics that may lead to breakthrough performance with continued training

Recommendations for Future Sessions

Curriculum Progression:

Continue with current simplified environment until performance improves
Gradually introduce terrain features after navigation is mastered
Incrementally increase enemy count and sophistication


Reward Engineering:

Implement intermediate rewards for approaching objectives
Add small rewards for enemy detection
Consider formation-based rewards for coordinated movement


Hyperparameter Refinement:

Maintain high entropy coefficient to preserve exploration
Consider reducing learning rate if training becomes unstable
Experiment with different GAE-lambda values (0.9-0.97) for advantage estimation


Technical Improvements:

Implement early stopping when performance plateaus
Add automatic hyperparameter adjustment based on performance metrics
Develop better visualization tools to analyze agent behavior patterns



The shift from Session 1 to Session 2 represents a significant improvement in training methodology, moving from a complex environment with poor exploration to a simplified environment with robust exploration. While agents haven't yet learned successful tactics, the fundamentals for effective learning are now in place.
