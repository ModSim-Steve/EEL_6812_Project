# Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for military Course of Action (COA) anaylsis

This project implements a sophisticated reinforcement learning framework for training tactical multi-agent systems in complex military simulation environments. Using a progressive curriculum approach, agents learn increasingly complex behaviors - from basic navigation to advanced tactical operations involving terrain management and enemy engagement.

The system features a carefully designed reward structure that balances team and individual incentives, a discretized action space that reduces dimensionality while preserving tactical richness, and target validation functions that incorporate doctrinal principles. Results demonstrate that this approach produces emergent tactical behaviors closely resembling human military tactics without explicit programming.

This research contributes to the field of tactical AI by demonstrating how properly structured learning environments can produce sophisticated behaviors through reinforcement learning rather than rule-based systems, potentially improving both training simulations and autonomous tactical decision-making applications.
